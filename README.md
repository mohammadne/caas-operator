# CaaS Ooperator

Container as a Service Operator

## Getting Started

### Development

> **_NOTE:_**   in this project we have changed the default Makefile and deployment strategy for the operators and due to that we don't generate rbac and webhooks automatically and instead hard-coded them into helm manifests, Also as we mentioned, we use Helm instead of Kustomize.
